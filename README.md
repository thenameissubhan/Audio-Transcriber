### 📄 Instructions

✅ Read the `how-to.txt` file.  

In the folder, you'll find **three `.exe` files**.

- **`Name v2`** is a long-term code build (I believe 🤷‍♂️).
- The other might be expired... or not. Who knows? 🙃

> 💡 **If you see an FFmpeg error saying it failed to download—don’t worry!**  
> I’ve already bundled `ffmpeg.exe` inside the `.exe`.  
> Just check the folder you selected; your converted `.mp3` files will be there.

### 🛠️ Optional: Remove the FFmpeg error

If you'd rather **remove that error message**, add FFmpeg to your system PATH.

1. Download FFmpeg from: [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)  
2. Select: `ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z`  
3. Extract the folder somewhere on any drive.
4. Inside the extracted folder, go to the `bin` directory. Example: 
 
>C:\Program Files (x86)\ffmpeg-<date>-git-<version>-essentials_build\bin

5. Copy that path.
6. Add it to your **System PATH** environment variable.

🤔 **How do you access the System PATH?**  
I'm done for now 😅.
