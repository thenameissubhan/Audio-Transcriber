Read the how-to .txt file.

In the folder, there are three .exe files.

Name v2 is a long-term code build, I believe.

And the other might be expired or not. Who knows? ðŸ™ƒ

> Lastly, if you get an FFmpeg error saying it failed to download, don't worry. I have already bundled the FFmpeg.exe within the .exe. So, just check the folder you selected; your converted .mp3 files will be there.

If you want to remove that error, add FFmpeg to the System PATH.

Download link:
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

And select:
ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z

Extract the folder and save it somewhere on any drive. Then, go to the bin folder, for example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\ffmpeg-date-git-version-essentials_build\bin

Add the location above to the System PATH.

How do you access the System PATH? I'm done for now.
